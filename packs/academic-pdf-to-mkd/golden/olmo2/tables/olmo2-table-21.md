caption: "Table 19 CO 2 emissions and water consumption during pretraining. We estimate the total carbon emissions and water consumption for our new models using PUE information from our data center providers, carbon intensity data and WUE from the local grid for each data center, and total power consumption from time series data logged throughout training. Numbers for Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama 3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), and the original OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024) are taken from their respective papers. We also show simulated water consumption for Llama 2 and 3, showing a range of water usage numbers using the lowest and highest WUE values for OLMo models."
