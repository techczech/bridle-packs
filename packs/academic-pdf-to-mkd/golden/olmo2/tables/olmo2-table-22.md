caption: "Table 20 Details of OLMES benchmarks used in OLMo 2 evaluation, with standardized choices of dataset split, number of instances to use, along with total number if sampling was used. For multiple-choice tasks, when using the Cloze/Completion Formulation (CF), the 'metric' column specifies which normalization scheme to use. Following the OLMES standard, we evaluate each model using both the MCF (Multiple-Choice Formulation) and CF formulations, and the best performing one is used. For efficiency reasons, we limit MMLU and held-out multiple-choice evaluations to MCF only as all the relevant models strongly prefer that format for these tasks."
